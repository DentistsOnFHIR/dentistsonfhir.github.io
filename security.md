## Security
Without a standard software developers are forced to find ways into the system.  Today these doorways into the system are locked front doors called APIs, where access is granted through keys and providers and vendors agree on what data they should have the ability to access.  Without an API, developers are forced to find backdoors where the key is left underneath a mat.  Obviously this is not good, but has been the only way forward.
