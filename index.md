## Why?
Dental records by default are not interoperable. Dental Electronic Medical Records EMRs are old, some still using flat files for databases. Software companies are forced to spend time and effort that gets passed as costs to the dentist who passes that cost down to patients. It does not have to be this way.

## Guiding Principles
* Dental records should have a standard API across platforms for developers to access
* API should be financially attainable for small startups to promote innovation
* Dentists should receive financial incentives for supporting interoperability
* API should be secure following the most modern standards available

## Technical Architecture

## What we do?
* Provide open source server implementations of the FHIR standard for EMRs that do not support our guiding principles
* Manage access between providers and software vendors through a secure web platform

## How you can help
* If you are a software vendor, become a supporting member by using Dentists On FHIR services to access dental records.
* If you are a dentist, give first choice to a software company who is a supporting member.
